The Flamingo toolbox is an open-source toolbox for image segmentation, classification and rectification.
It is developed by the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of Delft University of Technology for coastal image analysis.
The toolbox is built around the *scikit-image*, *scikit-learn*, *OpenCV* and *pystruct* toolboxes.

Flamingo is developed and maintained by [Bas Hoonhout](b.m.hoonhout@tudelft.nl) and [Max Radermacher](m.radermacher@tudelft.nl). Documentation can be found at (<http://openearth.github.io/flamingo>).
